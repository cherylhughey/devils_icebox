Learning a new tech stack as a lone developer can be tough. Looking up answers in Google and Stack Overflow can be creatively limiting. Thus, it is easy to hit the same wall over and over again.

In the perfect world, you'd have a buddy to take a quick look at your code or offer a new direction for finding answers. So, what can you do in lieu of having someone to ask for help?

I don't have the perfect solution, unfortunately. The most simple remedy I've found is to learn to work more than project at once and know when to step away. If you've reached a point where you feel like you're not learning, pick up a project that brings you joy. You can always circle back to the code bug later or choose to hit "DELETE."
