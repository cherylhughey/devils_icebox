Home Internet of Things (IoT) Security for Everyone

by Cheryl Hughey (www.cherylhughey.com)

Securing your home Internet is essential in our Internet of Things (IoT) world. The devices you use every day could be leaving an open door to hackers. If you don't believe you’re at risk, think again. Do you own a smart TV? Do you use a voice activated appliance like Amazon Echo? We all use these things and may even believe “it can’t happen to me.” Let's review a few short tips that may help protect your privacy and your wallet.

- The first thing to remember when securing your home from virtual or physical computer intruders is to never use default passwords. Why? Default passwords are common, can be published on the web and are easy to guess.  If you’re looking to secure your Smart TV, here is a great article by the FBI.

- When choosing a password, do not use names, birthdays, addresses, phone numbers or common anniversary dates. Unless you've reviewed your privacy settings and taken action, someone astute in social engineering need not look further than your Facebook account to find some of these very answers.

- Once you have a password in use, do not write it down or share it with others. Loose lips really do sink ships. Taping the password under your equipment is not a good idea. It is the first place an information thief will look. Memorize it or lose it.

- Change your passwords regularly and update your equipment drivers frequently. Old passwords and IoT that is never updated is easy prey for viruses and hackers.

- If you must share your computer with guests, quarantine their use to a guest account. Why? Your history, passwords and more can be easily found, if someone is using your Windows logon.

- Unplug non-essential IoT when not in use. In the event a breach is made of your home Internet, you will reduce the attack surface. 

- Review privacy and parental control options on each device. Restrict access to administrative functions and account changes to those who do not need it. Likewise, check your privacy settings on Internet accounts for places like Facebook and Google. Disconnect any apps no longer in use.

- Take stock of what IoT devices are in your home, what accounts they are accessing and what information they are holding in any history repositories. Choose to Opt Out of information sharing if available. You may need to do a bit of research to find these things, but they are there.

- Once you have an inventory of what electronic devices are connecting to the Internet in your home, consider decommissioning anything that you can no longer update. If a product is no longer supported, it can be easier to hack. While you may really love that old security camera from 10 years ago, is it really worth risking your privacy? Ditch it and find something that protects your family without leaving a critical backdoor open to hackers.

Follow these tips and you’ll have a great start to protecting the digital things you love in your home.
