 I love learning from the code of others in GitHub repositories. However, not everyone is using the same version of Ruby Gems or even Ruby itself. When you clone a repository and try to use it, you'll hit some roadblocks with "bundle install."  What is the solution? Open up the folder for your Rails app in a text editor and go to gemfile.lock and change the gem version to match the project. This is also a work around to installing RVM for different Ruby versions.
