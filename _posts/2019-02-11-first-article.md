Welcome to my new blog using Jekyll. I'm a frontend developer and writer that enjoys learning new frameworks and libraries. This will be the blog that will chronicle my various trials with new technologies. If you see something you like, be sure to <a href"mailto:cheryl@cherylhughey.com">Email me.</a>

This blog will serve as a chronicle of my most recent journey in web development. If you're a frontend traveler, it is my hope that you may find nuggets of inspiration here.
