Welcome to my new blog using Jekyll. I'm a frontend developer and writer that enjoys learning new frameworks and libraries. This will be the blog that will chronicle my various trials with new technologies. If you see something you like, be sure to <a href="mailto:cheryl@cherylhughey.com">Email me.</a>

This blog will serve as a chronicle of my most recent journey in web development. If you're a frontend traveler, it is my hope that you may find nuggets of inspiration here.

Project Notes: I forked my repository from jekyll/minima. The tools I'm using are Atom and GitHub Desktop to make changes. I've found using the command line easier than GitHub Desktop in the past. However, we seem to working together smoothly and it does keep good track of the changes. What I like so far about Jekyll is the ability to use Markdown and HTML. Markdown eliminates some of the tiring coding needed for spacing and headings when using HTML. I'd love to hear your thoughts. Feel free to email me a the link above.
