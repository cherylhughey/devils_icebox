#Secure Passwords 101

What is one of the most basics things that you can do to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your information system? Creating a password that is hard to hack is your first step in properly configuring a secure system. This blog article will teach you the basics of creating a secure password and help you protect your personal information.

Let’s start by defining what is not a secure password. A secure password is something that is simple to guess. It should not be your birth date, pet’s name, child’s name, anniversary or any date that could be easily identified to your profile.  Using a password of a common succession of numbers or letters is also not a good idea. As an example, using “1234567” or “abcdefg” is not a good idea. If you think adding the word “password” as a password, it is also not a good idea. Thus, do not use “password1234” or just “password” as your password. If you do, you may be living the door unlocked to your credit card numbers or personal information that could be used to steal your identity.

What is a good password? A good password should be something hard to guess. Hackers can use automated software to help crack the system. The longer the password and the more different types of characters you provide, the harder it is to crack. If you use “123456y,” it may not take very long for a hacker to reveal the password. However, a password like “!29giPy43?Hep7” may take longer to steal.

It is also important to protect your password from physical theft, shoulder surfers or social engineering It is highly advisable to never write down your password or give your password to anyone. One of the first places anyone will look is at notes tuck on your monitor, under your keyboard or in a drawer. Memorizing your password is a good habit. Never type your password while someone is looking over your shoulder. A good coworker will turn around while you type your password. If someone does not turn around, you can politely ask them to turn away to allow you to login. Also, be wary of people telling you they have an urgent need to work on a project. They may try to convince you through “social engineering” that they can’t get into the system due to no fault of their own. Perhaps they lost their password, their computer is broke or hundreds of other reasons. Never give your password to anyone for any reason, unless you can prove they are authorized by a higher authority to do so.

Another excellent security precaution is to change your passwords regularly to reduce the risk of password cracker software. For example, if you have been using the same password for the past year in every online account you use, you are potentially increasing the likelihood of an online hack of your system. Why? Hackers love to break into large company systems like your favorite retailer, steal users information and sell it on the dark web. If you have used the same password on several highly known retail sites, you are putting the security of your credit card and personal information at risk. If one system is compromised, a threat actor could use stolen passwords to hack several other systems at once. The more information they steal, the more vulnerable you will be. A good habit is to rotate your passwords at least every 60 days and do not use the same password across all websites that you use.

What type of threat actors want your passwords? They can simply be a lazy coworker or something more threatening like a hacktivist (someone doing so for political gain), disgruntled current or former employees, organized crime and more. They may try to establish themselves as your friend, make themselves familiar (the helpful repairman working near your desk), someone of authority (an email making false claims they are the government, police, etc.), sheer intimidation or even blackmail.  

Impersonation can be a common scenario. Here is one fictional example:
XYZ computer company calls you to tell you that they have been notified your computer has been hacked.  Only you can save your company right now. The only way to resolve the issue is to let the technician on the phone help you fix it. They mention the President of the company by name and tell you he said to do it now. When you agree, they ask for your login and password to the company cloud.  

What do you do? Do not give out any information. Go up your immediate chain of command to verify and get permission to proceed. Period.

In conclusion, you must be vigilant and protect your password. Knowledge of basic cyber security is your best weapon.
