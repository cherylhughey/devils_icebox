What is one of the most basics things that you can do to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your information system? Creating a password that is hard to hack is your first step in properly configuring a secure system. This blog article will teach you the basics of creating a secure password and help you protect your personal information.

Let’s start by defining what is not a secure password. A secure password is something that is simple to guess. It should not be your birth date, pet’s name, child’s name, anniversary or any date that could be easily identified to your profile.  Using a password of a common succession of numbers or letters is also not a good idea. As an example, using “1234567” or “abcdefg” is not a good idea. If you think adding the word “password” as a password, it is also not a good idea. Thus, do not use “password1234” or just “password” as your password. If you do, you may be living the door unlocked to your credit card numbers or personal information that could be used to steal your identity.

What is a good password? A good password should be something hard to guess. Hackers can use automated software to help crack the system. The longer the password and the more different types of characters you provide, the harder it is to crack. If you use “123456y,” it may not take very long for a hacker to reveal the password. However, a password like “!29giPy43?Hep7” may take longer to steal.

It is also important to protect your password from physical theft or shoulder surfers. It is highly advisable to never write down your password or give your password to anyone. One of the first places anyone will look is at notes tuck on your monitor, under your keyboard or in a drawer. Memorizing your password is a good habit. Never type your password while someone is looking over your shoulder. A good coworker will turn around while you type your password. If someone does not turn around, you can politely ask them to turn away to allow you to login.

Another excellent security precaution is to change your passwords regularly. For example, if you have been using the same password for the past year in every online account you use, you are potentially increasing the likelihood of an online hack of your system. Why? Hackers love to break into large company systems like your favorite retailer, steal users information and sell it on the dark web. If you have used the same password on several highly known retail sites, you are putting the security of your credit card and personal information at risk. If one system is compromised, a negative actor could use stolen passwords to hack several other systems at once. The more information they steal, the more vulnerable you will be. A good habit is to rotate your passwords at least every 60 days and do not use the same password across all websites that you use.

These are just a few password tips to help keep your information safe. Stay tuned for more basic security tips.
