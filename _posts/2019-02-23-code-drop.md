 I have achieved the greatest milestone set upon this earth. I have officially coded until I nodded off.

 Falling asleep while reading was one of my favorite things about becoming entranced by a book. Ever since I started learning to code, I haven't had much time to read things on paper. So, I guess I'll just settle with falling asleep in the recliner with my laptop still open. Perhaps I should make some coffee now. Code till you drop.
