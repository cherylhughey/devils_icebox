## My developer journey

I've been working on websites or blogs since the stale options of the old Geocities platform and WYSIWYG with Microsoft FrontPage. Currently, I enjoy seeing how far I can push the boundaries of integrating various frameworks. Having spent a number of years as a jazz publicist, building websites with open source code is a lot like jazz improvisation to me. Take a base idea and morphing it into a new piece of artwork is much like continuing a music conversation on a stage. It's exciting, fun and always unique.
