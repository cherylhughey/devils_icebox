## My developer journey

I probably started working on websites back during the uninspiring Geocities days and moved to the not so glorious Microsoft FrontPage WYSIWYG. Then, I fell in love with code. Currently, I enjoy seeing how far I can push the boundaries of integrating various frameworks. Having spent a number of years as a music publicist, building websites with open source code is a lot like jazz improvisation to me. Taking a base idea and morphing it into a new piece of artwork is much like continuing a music conversation on a stage. It's exciting, fun and always unique.

The name of this blog comes from a cave near Pilot Knob, Missouri. Having spent most of my childhood in an Ozark-inspired region in southeastern Missouri, storytelling is part of the culture. My Pop worked in the mines of the area and grew up nearby. I remember hearing bits and pieces about this cave that is no longer accessible to the public. It remains a creative fascination for me and perhaps inspiration for my own stories in the future.
